# Speed Reader

**This is a useless js app that won't speed up your reading! [Check this out](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/2015/01/19/speed-reading-redo/?utm_source=pocket_mylist)**

Paste the text you want to speedread, and click the **Read!** button. Additionally, you can set the reading speed, but the default 200 words per minute is optimal for an untrained reader.

This is a **Persian** translated fork of speed-reader with some other options such as speed meter and Persian translation and changes in interface.
